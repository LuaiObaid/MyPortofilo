        <h3>Software Engineer & Social Enthusiast</h3>
        <p>I am a software engineer with a passion for social interactions, football, meeting new people, and traveling. I have diverse experience working in both large companies and startups, honing my skills in full-stack and embedded development.</p>
        <p>At Knightec, I served as a full-stack/embedded developer, contributing to projects involving water level monitoring in plants, self-driving cars, and real-time temperature data analysis. I collaborated closely with cross-functional teams to ensure seamless integration of hardware and software components.</p>
        <p>During my tenure at Hestia Agora, a startup based in Malmö, I worked as a full-stack and React Native developer. In this role, I contributed to the development of web, iOS, and Android applications aimed at assisting individuals working with elderly domestic services. These applications included robust security features, allowing users to log in using their bank IDs. Additionally, we implemented features enabling users to assess the situation of the elderly and send reports to the relevant municipalities. I gained valuable experience in managing large-scale database systems, including those serving over 12 municipalities.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I am passionate about coding and have undertaken several personal projects to further my skills and explore emerging technologies:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>MERN Estate Web Application: A full-stack web application for real estate listings developed using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.</li>
          <li>Chat App Web Application: A full-stack web application for chatting in real time using socketIO developed using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.</li>
          <li>Restaurant App with Shopping Cart: A dynamic restaurant application featuring a comprehensive shopping cart, built using the MERN stack.</li>
          <li>Fruit and Vegetable Recognition System: Machine learning-based system for fruit and vegetable recognition implemented using Python, TensorFlow, and OpenCV.</li>
          <li>Face Detection Application: Python-based face detection application utilizing computer vision techniques.</li>
          <li>Smart Lock System with Arduino: Prototyped a smart lock system using Arduino for remote access control and monitoring.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These projects showcase my diverse skill set across various technologies, including web development, machine learning, computer vision, and embedded systems. They also reflect my commitment to continuous self-improvement and exploration of emerging technologies.</p>
